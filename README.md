In the grade analyzer,
I took student array of objects with name and score. 
Then created one array of scores. Then created the following functions:

Average Marks:
  In this, I took the scores array and calculated sum and divived it by the array length.
Highest and Lowest Score:
  In this, I created one function for both highest and lowest score. I took the students array and using Math found the highest and lowest score. Based   on that i found th student name.
Grade Distribution:
  In this,I used the student array and ran a for each loop and in that use else if condtions to find and store the frequency of the grades.
Students needing retake:
  In this, I used the students array and used a foreach loop to find student name with less than 60 score using if condition.
